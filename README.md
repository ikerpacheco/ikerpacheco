### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

-----------------------------

My name is Iker and I am 19. I am currently studying Software Development and IT at EPITECH Barcelona. Here, I achieved to validate the first year without failing a module. I am currently searching for an internship in a company.

In this github you are going to see some of my school projects. If you have any concern, don't hesitate to ask me!
